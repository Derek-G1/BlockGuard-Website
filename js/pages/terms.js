    <p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT BY DOWNLOADING, Browse, OR OTHERWISE USING THE
    CONTENT, SERVICES AND TOOLS OFFERED BY THE APPS, YOU HAVE AGREED, WITHOUT LIMITATION OR
    QUALIFICATION, TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE AND ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS THAT MAY
    APPLY. If you do not agree with these Terms of Use, please do not download or use the Apps.</p>
    <p>The Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of
    these Terms of Use, at any time, consistent with applicable law. You agree to be bound by this
    Agreement and any amendments made thereto in the future so long as you utilize the Apps. It is your
    responsibility to check these Terms of Use periodically for changes. The Company will post a notification
    on the Apps or otherwise provide notice to you if these Terms of Use materially change. Such changes,
    whether in the form of modifications, additions, or deletions, shall become effective when specified in
    the relevant notification. If you do not agree to the changes, uninstall and do not continue to use the
    Apps after the date they become effective. Your continued use of the Apps following the posting of
    changes will mean that you accept and agree to the changes. As long as you comply with these Terms of
    Use, the Company grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited privilege to download,
    browse, and use the Apps.</p>
    <h2>Content & Intellectual Property</h2>

    granting you any right or license in the Intellectual Property.</p>
    <p>When accessing the Apps, you agree to obey the law and to respect the intellectual property rights of
    the Company and third parties. You agree that you shall be solely responsible for any violations of any

    otherwise exploited in any way (including, but not limited to, by “mirroring”) to any other computer,
    server, webapps or other medium for publication or distribution or for any commercial enterprise,
    without the Company’s express prior written consent.</p>
    <p>You may not use any “deep-link”, “page-scrape”, “robot”, “spider” or other automatic device, program,

    monitor any portion of the Apps or their hosted content, or in any way reproduce or circumvent the
    navigational structure or presentation of the Apps, to obtain or attempt to obtain any materials,
    documents or information through any means not purposely made available to you through the Apps.</p>
    <p>You may not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion or feature of the Apps, or any other

    Apps.</p>
    <p>Accounts may not be shared and may only be used by one individual per account.</p>
    <p>You agree that you will not take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large
    load on the infrastructure of the Apps or the Company’s systems or networks, or any systems or
    networks connected to the Apps or to the Company.</p>
    <p>You agree not to use any device, software or routine to interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper
    working of the Apps or any transaction being conducted on the Apps, or with any other person’s use of
    the Apps, including, but not limited to, by interfering or attempting to interfere with service to any
    visitor, host, or network, such as by means of submitting a virus or any other harmful component to this
    Apps, or by overloading, “flooding,” “spamming,” “mail bombing,” or “crashing” this Apps. In addition,
    you agree not to use this Apps to send unsolicited e-mail, including, without limitation, promotions, or
    advertisements for products or services. You also agree not to frame or utilize framing techniques to
    enclose any aspect of this Apps, such as any trademark, logo, or other proprietary information
    (including, but not limited to, images, text, page layout, or form), or to use any metatags or any other
    “hidden text” utilizing the Company’s name or trademarks without the Company’s express written
    consent.</p>
    <p>You may not forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers in order to disguise the origin of any
    message or transmittal you send to the Company on or through the Apps or any service offered on or
    through the Apps. You may not pretend that you are, or that you represent, someone else, or
    impersonate any other individual or entity.</p>
    <p>You may not use the Apps, including, but not limited to, any Content or Materials contained therein, for
    any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms of Use, or to solicit the performance of any
    illegal activity or other activity which infringes the rights of the Company or others. Without limiting the
    generality of any terms or conditions set forth herein, in using the Apps, you may not transmit or solicit:
    (a) any unlawful, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, pornographic, profane or
    indecent information of any kind, including images and language; (b) any message that constitutes, or
    encourages or incites conduct that would constitute, a criminal offense or gives rise to civil liability; or
    (c) any information, software or other material which violates or infringes upon the rights of others,
    including material which is an invasion of privacy or publicity rights or which is protected by copyright,
    trademark or other proprietary right, or derivative works with respect thereto, without first obtaining
    permission from the owner or right holder. Any violation of the Company’s system or network security
    may subject you to civil and/or criminal liability.</p>
    <h2>3. Feedback & User Content</h2>
    <p>The Apps do not collect any personally identifiable information, such as your name, e-mail address,
    physical address, phone number(s), and credit card information (collectively, “PII”) that you may provide
    to the Company, or any on-device data, all of which is subject to the privacy standards set forth in the
    Company’s Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>To access parts of this Apps or some of the resources it offers, you may be asked to provide certain
    information, including, but not limited to, PII. It is a condition of your use of the Apps that all the
    information you provide on this Apps, including, but not limited to, PII, is correct, current and complete.</p>
    <p>Separate and apart from information collection, the Apps may need to access user data, including but
    not necessarily limited to: call logs, contact lists, SMS content, user-defined block/whitelist rules, DND
    settings. This access is used solely for the Apps’ functionality, subject to user permissions, and none of
    this information is collected apart from on-device functions and local storage and encryption.</p>
    <h2>4. Purchases; Other Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <p>Additional terms and conditions may apply to purchases of goods or services and to specific portions or
    features of the Apps, including, but not limited to, contests, promotions or other similar features (as
    further described in Section 5 below), all of which terms are made a part of these Terms of Use by this
    reference. You agree to abide by such other terms and conditions, including where applicable
    representing that you are of sufficient legal age to use or participate in such service or feature. If there is
    a conflict between these Terms of Use and the terms posted for or applicable to a specific portion of the
    Apps or for any service offered on or through the Apps, the latter terms shall control with respect to
    your use of that portion of the Apps or the specific service. The Company may make changes to any
    products or services offered on the Apps, or to the applicable prices for any such products or services, at
    any time, in accordance with the notice procedures set forth above.</p>
    <p>You may cancel any subscription at any time – however, there are no refunds for cancellation. Payments
    are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used billing periods. Unfortunately,
    we are unable to refund subscriptions via iOS or Google Play subscriptions. All such subscriptions must
    be cancelled or changed directly through the applicable platform.</p>
    <p>You can cancel your subscription at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Service for the
    remainder of your applicable billing cycle. If you cancel your subscription, your subscription will
    automatically end at the end of your current billing period. If you signed up using your account with a
    third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your subscription, you may need to do so through
    that third party (such as Apple or Google) by visiting your account with the applicable third party and
    unsubscribing through that third party.</p>
    <p>Your subscription may begin with a free trial. The duration of the free trial period of your subscription
    will be specified during checkout and is intended to allow first-time subscribers to try our Services. Trials
    require at least one valid Payment Method associated with your account. We will charge the
    subscription fee for your next billing cycle to your Payment Method at the end of the free trial period
    and your subscription will automatically start unless you cancel your prior to the end of the free trial
    period. Once a charge is made, there is no refund available and you will need to follow the cancellation
    process to avoid being charged at the completion of your current billing period. It is the responsibility of
    the member to keep track of the account expiration date and cancel prior to renewal.</p>
    <h2>5. Sweepstakes, Contests, and Promotions</h2>
    <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, ownership and use of all User Content, Feedback, and PII submitted in
    connection with a sweepstakes, contest, giveaway or other promotion (“Promotion”), shall be subject to
    the applicable Promotion’s “Official Rules” or other terms of service. If you participate in a Promotion,
    such terms of service, may, for example, permit the Company to contact you to verify your eligibility, use
    your physical address for the purposes of prize fulfillment, share your PII with third parties providing
    services in connection with such Promotion or for purposes of prize fulfillment, and/or use other
    information submitted with your entry for future marketing, such as to notify you of a product or
    subsequent Promotion that we think may be of interest to you. If you no longer wish to receive
    information about products or Promotions, you may opt out of receiving further information by clicking
    on the “Unsubscribe” link included in such e-mails. Please also note that if you win a Promotion, some of
    your PII may be disclosed on a winners list as required by law.</p>
    <h2>6. Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Company’s Privacy Policy applies to use of this Apps, and its terms are made a part of these Terms
    of Use by this reference. Additionally, by using the Apps, you acknowledge and agree that Internet
    transmissions are never completely private or secure. You understand that any message or information
    you send to the Apps may be read or intercepted by others, even if there is a special notice that a
    particular transmission (for example, credit card information) is encrypted.</p>
    <h2>7. Third-Party Content, Links and Services</h2>
    <p>The Apps may display content or tools provided by third parties, links to third-party web pages, or both,
    including advertisements and solicitations to purchase products or services (collectively, “Third-Party
    Content”). In consideration for the convenience of the Company making this Third-Party Content
    available or accessible to you, you acknowledge that the Company has not reviewed all of the ThirdParty Content and that the Company is not responsible or liable for any such Third-Party Content,
    including, but not limited to, the privacy practices of third parties offering such Third-Party Content; you
    must contact the third party directly for any remedies that may be available to you. Please be aware
    that access to any Third-Party Content does not constitute an endorsement by the Company or any of its
    subsidiaries or affiliates of any third parties or Third-Party Content. Likewise, the Company is not the
    seller of products purchased from third parties offering Third-Party Content and is in no way responsible
    for shipping their products. The Company may from time to time engage certain affiliates or other third
    parties to provide all or part of the Services to you, and you hereby acknowledge and agree that such
    third party participation is acceptable.</p>
    <p>If the Company provides links to social media platforms, such as Facebook or Twitter, and you choose to
    visit those websites through the Company’s links, please note that the information you post, transmit, or
    otherwise make available on those websites may be viewed by the general public. The Company does
    not control User Content on social media homepages and is not responsible for any third-party use of
    your User Content that you have posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available there.</p>
    <h2>8. Monitoring; Copyright Complaints</h2>
    <p>You agree that the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor, edit, disclose, refuse to
    post, or remove at any time, for any reason in the Company’s sole discretion, any Material and Content
    anywhere on the Apps. Notwithstanding this right, the Company does not and cannot review all
    Materials, User Content, PII, and Feedback submitted to the Apps. If notified, the Company may
    investigate an allegation that content transmitted to the Company is in violation of these Terms of Use,
    and the Company will determine whether to have the communication removed. However, the Company
    is under no obligation to remove content and assumes no responsibility or liability arising from or
    relating to any actions or content transmitted by or between you or any third party within or outside of
    the Apps, including, but not limited to, any error, defamation, libel, slander, omission, falsehood,
    obscenity, pornography, profanity, danger, or inaccuracy contained therein.</p>
    <p>The Company may, in appropriate circumstances and at its sole discretion, terminate the access of users
    who infringe the copyrights of others. If you believe that your work has been copied and is accessible on
    this Apps in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, you may notify the Company by providing the

    <h2>9. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>THE COMPANY DOES NOT PROMISE THAT THE APPS OR ANY CONTENT, PRODUCT, SERVICE OR FEATURE
    OF THE APPS WILL BE AVAILABLE, ERROR-FREE, OR UNINTERRUPTED, OR THAT ANY DEFECTS WILL BE
    CORRECTED, OR THAT YOUR USE OF THE APPS WILL PROVIDE SPECIFIC RESULTS. THE APPS AND THEIR
    CONTENT ARE DELIVERED ON AN “AS-IS” AND “AS-AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY
    KIND. ALL INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THE APPS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE. THE
    COMPANY CANNOT ENSURE THAT THE APPS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY FILES OR OTHER
    DATA YOU DOWNLOAD FROM THE APPS, WILL BE FREE OF VIRUSES OR CONTAMINATION OR
    DESTRUCTIVE FEATURES. THE COMPANY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
    INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF ACCURACY, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE COMPANY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL
    LIABILITY FOR THE ACTS, OMISSIONS AND CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH OR
    RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE APPS AND/OR ANY SERVICES OF THE COMPANY. YOU ASSUME TOTAL
    RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR USE OF THE APPS AND ANY THIRD-PARTY CONTENT. YOUR SOLE REMEDY
    AGAINST THE COMPANY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE APPS OR ANY CONTENT IS TO STOP USING
    THE APPS OR ANY SUCH CONTENT. THIS LIMITATION OF RELIEF IS A PART OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN
    THE PARTIES.</p>
    <p>You understand that the Apps contains information but that this information and Content does not
    constitute “advice”, nor does it constitute any “recommendation” on whether or how to engage in
    activities relating to the subject matter. THE COMPANY ACCEPTS NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY
    WHATSOEVER FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF ANY OF THE APPS,
    INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CONTENT OR MATERIAL FOUND THEREIN, OR AS A RESULT OF
    BETTING RISKS OR MONETARY INVESTMENTS. ANY ACTIVITY IS UNDERTAKEN AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
    <h2>10. Applicable Law and Venue; Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>By use of this Apps you irrevocably consent to the application of the laws of the Commonwealth of
    Wyoming, without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions, to govern any and all disputes with the
    Company related to these Terms of Use. Subject to the injunctive relief terms set forth herein, you also
    irrevocably consent to the exclusive venue of the courts of Wyoming or the U.S. District Court for the
    District of Wyoming. If you access the Apps from outside of the United States, you do so at your own risk
    and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>Any dispute relating in any way to your visit to this Apps shall be submitted to confidential arbitration in
    Wyoming, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate the
    Company’s intellectual property rights, the Company may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in
    any state or federal court, and you consent to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Arbitration under
    these Terms of Use shall be conducted under the rules then prevailing of the American Arbitration
    Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and before a single arbitrator.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, the selected arbitrator must have expertise in the subject matter of the dispute. The
    expenses of the arbitration charged by the arbitrator shall be borne by the prevailing party or otherwise
    as appropriately allocated between the parties to the arbitration by the arbitrator in his or her
    discretion. However, in every other regard each party shall pay for and bear its own costs and legal fees,
    costs and expenses. The arbitration shall be completed within one hundred twenty (120) days of either
    giving notice or filing a demand to arbitrate with the American Arbitration Association (whichever shall
    first occur).</p>
    <p>The arbitrator’s award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent
    jurisdiction. The testimony, evidence, ruling and all documentation regarding any arbitration shall be
    considered confidential information. Neither party may use, disclose, or divulge any such information
    unless otherwise required by law.</p>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under these Terms of Use shall be
    joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these Terms of Use, whether through class
    arbitration proceedings or otherwise. You agree to an arbitration on an individual basis. In any dispute,
    NEITHER YOU NOR THE COMPANY WILL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST
    OTHER VISITORS IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIM AS A CLASS
    REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. The arbitral tribunal
    may not consolidate more than one (1) person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of
    a representative or class proceeding. The arbitral tribunal has no power to consider the enforceability of
    this class arbitration waiver and any challenge to the class arbitration waiver may only be raised in a
    court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
    <h2>11. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Subject to all other terms herein, specifically Sections 9 and 13 related to disclaimers and limitations of
    Company liability, it is always your responsibility to configure and use the Apps in the proper manner
    and to educate yourself about App functionality before attempting to use the Apps. Some functions of
    the Apps require designation as the Default Handler, which can impact other hardware or software
    functionality. You bear the responsibility for the outcome, intended or not.</p>
    <p>You are responsible for remembering, maintaining, and storing your backup encryption password. The
    Company does not store your password and does not have a workaround to access your account or your
    encrypted data if your password is inaccessible. All backup files and data are stored locally on your
    device (or other chosen storage device); the Company does not store any files or data on Company
    servers or elsewhere.</p>

    THE APPS. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO PREVENT RECOVERY OF DIRECT, INDIRECT,
    INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM ANY
    CLAIM RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, WHETHER SUCH CLAIM IS
    BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY
    EVEN IF THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
    <p>The above limitation applies to your use, misuse, or reliance upon the Apps, including, without
    limitation, damages you may incur because of Third-Party Content advertised on, or linked to the Apps.</p>
    <p>Any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to this Apps must be commenced within one (1)
    year after the claim or cause of action arises.</p>
    <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, the shortening of the applicable
    statute of limitations, or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages.
    Accordingly, in certain jurisdictions, some of the above limitations may not apply to you; all other
    provisions of these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
    <h2>14. Indemnity</h2>

    directors, employees, consultants, agents, licensors, and suppliers from and against any and all claims,
    losses, expenses, liabilities, settlements, litigation, damages, and/or costs (including, but not limited to,
    fees, costs and other expenses of attorneys and expert witnesses) arising out of or related to: (i) your
    use of the Apps, including, but not limited to, any Materials or User Content, (ii) any violation of these
    Terms of Use or applicable law by you in connection with your use of the Apps, including, but not limited
    to, any Materials or User Content, (iii) any actual or alleged infringement by you, or any person
    accessing the Apps, including, but not limited to, any Materials or User Content, using your password or
    account identifier, of any intellectual property or privacy or other right of any third party, or (iv) any
    unauthorized use of password protected Materials or User Content utilizing your account information,
    whether or not known or authorized by you.</p>
    <p>The Company reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any
    matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you at your expense, and you shall not in any event
    settle or otherwise dispose of any matter without the Company’s prior written consent.</p>
    <h2>15. Rights to Terminate Use</h2>
    <p>Upon termination of your account for any reason, the Company will retain your data in accordance with
    its Privacy Policy. Even if your account is terminated, be aware that these Terms of Use, to the extent
    any provisions by their nature will survive any expiration or termination of these Terms of Use, shall so
    survive.</p>
    <p>To the extent that any part of this Apps offers subscriptions to users, the Company reserves the right to
    cancel any such subscriptions at any time in its sole and absolute discretion, upon which time affected
    users shall be notified of such cancellation.</p>
    <p>You agree that the Company reserves the right, without prejudice to its other rights, to suspend or
    terminate your use of the Apps at any time where the Company has determined, in its sole discretion
    that the use of the Apps by you is, or was, in breach of these Terms of Use. ACCORDINGLY, IN ITS SOLE
    DISCRETION, IN ADDITION TO ANY OTHER RIGHTS OR REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY AND
    WITHOUT ANY LIABILITY WHATSOEVER, THE COMPANY AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT NOTICE MAY
    TERMINATE OR RESTRICT ACCESS YOUR ACCESS TO THE APPS AND/OR THE SERVICES.</p>
    <p>You also agree that any violation by you of these Terms of Use may constitute an unlawful and unfair
    business practice and cause irreparable harm to the Company, for which monetary damages would be
    inadequate, and you consent to the Company obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that the
    Company deems necessary or appropriate in such circumstances. These remedies are in addition to any

    <p>The Company’s failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms of
    Use shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the course of conduct between
    the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any of these Terms of Use. The Company may assign its
    rights and duties under these Terms of Use to any party at any time without notice to you and without
    your express consent. You will not assign any of your rights or delegate any of your obligations under
    these Terms of Use without the Company’s prior written consent. Any purported assignment or
    delegation in violation of this Section is null and void. No assignment or delegation relieves you of any of
    your obligations under these Terms of Use. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held unlawful, void,
    or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms of
    Use and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Any provisions which

    together with the Company’s Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between the parties
    pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes in their entirety any and all written or oral
