<h2>2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
<p>In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is
necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so
under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide

your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>

<h3>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</h3>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us
to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal
information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process
your personal information:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Consent.</b> We may process your information if you have given us
        permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a
        specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn
        more about withdrawing your consent.</li>
    <li><b>Legal Obligations.</b> We may process your information where we

        exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as
        evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
    <li><b>Vital Interests.</b> We may process your information where we believe
        it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a

        of any person.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</h3>
<p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission
(i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific
purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e.,
implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
<p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable
law to process your information without your consent, including, for
example:</p>
<ul>

        cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
    <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
    <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
    <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is
        necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
    <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating
        with next of kin</li>
    <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is,
        or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
    <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would
        compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and
        the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a
        breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or
        a province</li>
    <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court
        order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
    <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment,
        business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the

    <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
    <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the
        regulations</li>
    <li>We may disclose de-identified information for approved research or
        statistics projects, subject to ethics oversight and confidentiality

<h2>5. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY
WEBSITES?</h2>
<p>In Short: We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you
share with third parties that we may link to or who advertise on our
Services, but are not affiliated with, our Services.</p>
<p>The Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile
applications and/or contain advertisements from third parties that are not
affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, services, or
applications. Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any
such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused
by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The
inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does
not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the safety and
privacy of data you provide to any third-party websites. Any data collected
by third parties is not covered by this Privacy Notice. We are not
responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of
any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that
may be linked to or from the Services. You should review the policies of
such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.</p>

<h2>6. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING
TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
<p>In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect
and store your information.</p>
<p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons
and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services.
Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our
Services, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with
basic site functions.</p>
<p>We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking
technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help
manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your
interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on
your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers
use their technology to provide advertising about products and services
tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on
other websites.</p>
<p>To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a
"sale"/"sharing" (which includes targeted advertising, as defined under the
applicable laws) under applicable US state laws, you can opt out of these
online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described below
under section "DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC
PRIVACY RIGHTS?"</p>
<p>Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can
refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.</p>

<h3>Google Analytics</h3>
<p>We may share your information with Google Analytics to track and analyze
the use of the Services. The Google Analytics Advertising Features that we
may use include: Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display
Network Impressions Reporting and Google Analytics Demographics and
Interests Reporting. To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across
the Services, visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. You can opt
out of Google Analytics Advertising Features through Ads Settings and Ad
Settings for mobile apps. Other opt out means include
http://optout.networkadvertising.org/ and
http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice. For more information on
the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy & Terms
page.</p>

<h2>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
<p>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the
purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention
period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other
legal requirements).</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information,
or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your
personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion
is possible.</p>

<h2>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
<p>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
organizational and technical security measures.</p>
<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or
other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we
will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You
should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

<h2>9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM
MINORS?</h2>
<p>In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children
under 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your
jurisdiction.</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under
18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your
jurisdiction, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using
the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or the equivalent age
as specified by law in your jurisdiction or that you are the parent or
guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of
the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18
years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction
has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable
measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become
aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18 or
the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction, please contact
us at privacy@blockguard.app.</p>

<h2>10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
<p>In Short: Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some
regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom
(UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater
access to and control over your personal information. You may review,
change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country,
province, or state of residence.</p>
<p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have
certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the
right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information,
(ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your
personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be
subject to automated decision-making. If a decision that produces legal or
similarly significant effects is made solely by automated means, we will
inform you, explain the main factors, and offer a simple way to request
human review. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to
object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a
request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the
section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.
We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable
data protection laws.</p>
<p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully
processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain
to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection
authority.</p>
<p>If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data
Protection and Information Commissioner.</p>
<p><b>Withdrawing your consent:</b> If we are relying on your consent to process
your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent
depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your
consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by
contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW
CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>
<p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it
affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on
lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
<p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may
email us at privacy@blockguard.app.</p>

<h2>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
online Browse activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform
technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a
revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser
DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard
for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this
time.</p>

<h2>12. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE
SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
<p>In Short: If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut,
Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have the right to request
access to and receive details about the personal information we maintain
about you and how we have processed it, correct inaccuracies, get a copy
of, or delete your personal information. You may also have the right to
withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal information.
These rights may be limited in some circumstances by applicable law. More
information is provided below.</p>
