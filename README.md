## What Block Guard Can Do

### Call Blocking & Protection
Block Guard can protect you from:
- **Private numbers**
- **Unknown numbers**
- **Foreign / international numbers**
- **Non-contacts (Strict Mode / Contacts Only)**

You choose how aggressive it is, and you can always add exceptions.

---

### Anti-Scam & Anti-Spoofing
Built-in defenses against common scam tactics:
- **Block Spoofed Calls (STIR/SHAKEN)**  
  Block calls that fail carrier verification (when available on your device/carrier).
- **Neighbor Spoofing Protection**  
  Blocks unknown numbers that mimic your **area code & prefix** (a common scam pattern).
- **Block Known Spammers (Offline Community Database)**  
  Optional blocking using an offline community spam list.

---

### Advanced Blocking Rules (More Than Just “Block This Number”)
Block Guard supports multiple rule types:
- **Block specific numbers**
- **Block number patterns** (supports wildcard-style patterns)
- **Area code blocking**
- **Prefix blocking**
- **Country code / blocked countries**
- Quick actions to block/allow from history and logs

---

### Whitelist & Exceptions (Let the Right People Through)
You can allow calls/texts even when other rules are strict:
- **Whitelist specific numbers**
- **Whitelist prefixes**
- **Whitelist area codes**
- **Allowed contacts list**
- **Whitelist override controls** (especially useful when DND/modes are enabled)

---

### Call Handling Actions (What Happens When a Call Is Blocked)
You can choose what Block Guard does with blocked calls:
- **Reject (Hang Up)** — caller gets a disconnect tone
- **Silence (Voicemail)** — sent to voicemail without ringing
- **Answer & Drop (default phone only)**  
  If Block Guard is your **default Phone app**, it can answer blocked calls and immediately hang up.  
  If not, it will reject via call screening behavior instead.

> Some actions depend on device/Android version and whether Block Guard is set as your default Phone app.

---

## Profiles & Modes

### Blocking Profiles (Customize Different Protection Styles)
Create and edit profiles with their own rules, including:
- Block private / unknown / foreign
- **Strict Mode (Contacts Only)**
- Block spoofed calls (STIR/SHAKEN)
- Optional **text blocking** per profile
- Choose call handling action (reject / silence)
- Apply global blocklist/whitelist integrations

Great for switching between “Work,” “Sleep,” “Family,” etc.

---

### Scheduled Blocking
Set blocking schedules with:
- **Custom name**
- **Start & end times**
- **Days of the week**
- Master enable/disable

This makes it easy to automate protection during sleep, work, or focus hours.

### Do Not Disturb Style Mode (Block Guard Mode)
Enable a dedicated DND-style mode with options like:
- Toggle DND/mode on/off
- Whitelist override behavior
